# PostCraft
### This full-stack project, initially developed as a backend service for a larger private application, allows users to register accounts, create, update, and delete posts in real time. User data is securely stored and retrieved from a database, with additional focus on authentication, network security, input validation, and database management. To showcase the functionality independently, I built a front-end interface and hosted the project on AWS. This demo highlights my contributions to the original backend and demonstrates a full-stack implementation, emphasizing skills in secure data handling, system integration, and cloud deployment.
